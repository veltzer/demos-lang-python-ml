- solve the feature engineering problem as described in:
	https://github.com/veltzer/demos-ml-python/blob/master/exercises/02_feature_engineering.txt

- do the matplotlib exercise (redo).

- do the linear regression exercise knowing what were the problems:
	- columns which are not linearly correlated as bad.
		either get rid of them or turn them to linear correlation
	- colimsn which are not correlated at all are just disturbting the algorithm
		get rid of them
	- engineer new features
