Take the generic example called learn.py from my github repo:
	http://github.com/veltzer/demos-ml-python

Remove column by column from the data and rerun.
At first iteration remove one column
At second iteration remove two column...
...

What do you guess will happen to our success of prediction?

Is this way of ranking the "importance" of columns fail safe?
	Think about it.

Now at every iteration remove just one column
At first iteration remove column 0 only
At second iteration remove column 1 only
....

And again, at every iteration record our success rate.

This is an alternative way of estimating the "importance" of each column for predicting the result.

Did the ways of estimation agree? If yes - Why? if no -> Why?

Notes:
* Never remove the Survive column.
