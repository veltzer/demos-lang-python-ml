Solve the titanic problem using linear regression

Points to remember:
* In order to use linear regression you need all columns to be numeric.
* Linear regression is an *estimation* algorithm and not a *classification* algorithm.
* In order for linear reg to be successful you should try to make it so as many columns
	as possible are linearly correlated with the Y column.
	So you may need to do some transformations on some of the columns.
