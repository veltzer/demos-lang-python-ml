Give the following python function:

def square(x):
	return x*x

find the x that generates a minimum for this function
(I know that you all understand that x=0 is the solution but the idea is to do that with an algorithm
and not using your brain).

What you produce is a piece of code that follows the newton raphson method
and finds the x for which square(x) is minimum.

Reminder: the newton-raphson method
1. guess x
2. mesure derivitive of x by visition close by points.
3. if the derivitive is close enough to zero -> stop
4. if it is not, follow the downward slope of the derivitive
	and guess a new value for x
	and return to step 2.
