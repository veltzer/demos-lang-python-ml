	https://stackabuse.com/overview-of-classification-methods-in-python-with-scikit-learn/
- Go to the documentation of scikit-learn
- Find a list of all classification algoritms.
- Choose 2 (better not to choose DecisionTreeClassifier which we have already abused to death)
- Use those 2 algorithms to solve the Titanic problem.
- Read the documentation of the algorithms.
- Try to play with their parameters to improve their performance.
- *** There is NO NEED to do any feature engineering in this exercise ***
