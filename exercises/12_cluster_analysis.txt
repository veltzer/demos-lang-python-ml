Cluster the titanic data.

Use the K-Means algorithm from the scikit-learn

You have to do the following things to make the results have meaning...
- remove un-needed and un-interesting columns (e.g. id)
- turn everything numerical (with some common sense)
- normalize the data

And then you just run the k-mean algorithm.

Run the algorithm with different values for the 'n_clusters' parameters
and find a good value for the number of clusters (hint: 897 is not a good value).
We want a value between 2 and 15.
