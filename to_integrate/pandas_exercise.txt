Load a pandas frame and do the following:
- add a column which has the data in some other column + 1
- remove a column
- rename a column
- remove a row
- add a row
- see what type a column is made of
- change the type of a column (either at runtime or at load time)
- find the mean, variance and quotiles of a certain column.

and invent other things to do on your own...
